# Hi there, I'm Eka Saputra ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior developer based in sunny Singapore, passionate about building user-friendly and efficient applications. My journey into the world of tech was sparked by a fascination with how apps like Grab work. I wanted to build something just as useful, and I've been hooked on coding ever since!
