### Hi there 👋

I'm Eka Saputra — a passionate student and aspiring developer currently learning how to build digital products that support children's health and parenting.

- 🌱 I’m learning how to create a startup platform called **Hi Kids!** — a concept focused on child healthcare and parenting tips with inspiring, interactive, and educational content.
- 🔧 I'm exploring how to build web applications using **Laravel**, **Vue**, and **Tailwind CSS**, including features like authentication with **Jetstream + Inertia.js**.
- 💡 I’m working on features such as:
  - 🤖 Chatbots for disease detection
  - 🧑‍⚕️ Doctor chat and video calls
  - 🛍 Baby product marketplace
  - 📆 Vaccination & growth tracking schedules
  - 🧾 Vouchers, parenting articles, and notifications
- 🎨 I’m also learning to implement **mobile-friendly UI designs** from **Figma**, aiming for a look and feel that’s friendly for both kids and parents.
- 📦 I'm developing the concept of **affordable and cute baby parcels** as an early product idea.
- 👥 I collaborate with a small student team from IT, Design, and Management backgrounds — all working together with limited time but big ideas.
- 📫 How to reach me: none
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m building this project from zero, combining tech skills and startup thinking to solve real problems for families.

Thanks for visiting my profile! 🚀
